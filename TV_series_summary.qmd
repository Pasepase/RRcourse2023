Each season has an iteration of the Doctor all of which had attracted different viewers and received different reviews.

The viewership peaked in the era of the 10th doctor, especially in the year `r max_year` and has been declining ever since, with the latest seasons having record low rankings in the `r doctor_min_avg_rating` re-run.
